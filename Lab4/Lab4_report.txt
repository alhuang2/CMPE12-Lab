Purpose:
The purpose of this lab is to learn subroutines and abstract implementation
of 2 dimensional arrays

Procedure:
I started off with the prompts and variable creations. Next I moved onto the Store 
function/subroutine. I selected to follow Row Major and for the first few hours
I was confused as to how I was supposed to implement a Row and Column into
a technically speaking one dimensional array. Figured out that first half of
the array address is Row 0 with columns 1-200 and then second half of the array
address was Row 1 with columns 1-200. With that, I knew how to create a store function.

Load was next, and load was nearly identical with store except with one less input
and just stores the grabbed item into a variable (RETCHAR) 

Encrypt function was next. Heres my quick pseudocode of how i bound checked
	if x < 65
		disregard
	if x <= 90
		encrypt upper letter
	if x <= 97
		disregard because x is 90 < x  97
	if x <= 122
		encrypt smaller leter
	if x > 122
		disregard
As for the encryption algorithm, 
	if (char + cipher)  > Z or z, 
		do char + cipher - 26
		//this would loop back the character
	else 
		store char + cipher

Decrypt function was next. Same bound check. Used encryption algo except
	if (char - cipher) < A or a
		do char - cipher + 26
	else
		store char - cipher

Print function was last function i needed. I used my encryption flag as a way
of determining which Row to print first. 
	if encryption flag was 1 
		print row 1 first
		then print row 0
	if encryption flag was 0
		print row 0 first
		then print row 1

Conlclusion:
It was a tough lab that took way too long. A lot of misunderstanding of the prompt and 
implementation of the method. I had finished the lab without doing these subroutines
and Row/Column implementation but soon found out that the lab required these subroutines thus taking a lot longer to do and a lot more frustration. It was not so much of a test of
subroutines, but instead it was a test of abstract thinking..
